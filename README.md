# gdp-income-inflation-dashboard
Understanding income change over time through the lens of GDP, inflation, and consumer expenses.

My Tasks:

- Project 2 REDO:

- Connect all charts to one slider on homepage
- Create two interesting visualizations each:
--> TREE MAPS (one page) 
----> per cap gdp (difference)
----> Median Income (difference)
--> Drop Down between PCE Energy or Food vs CPI
----> CPI Change
----> PCE Energy & Food
take note of differences between above two.
add descriptions!
